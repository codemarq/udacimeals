## Lesson Summary
We covered a lot in this lesson. To recap:

- The reducer is responsible for deciding the shape and the initial state of the store and when an action is dispatched, the state it returns will become the new state of the store.
- The state of Redux is stored in the Store.
- An action is a payload of information describing state changing events that occur in the application.
- The store can be used to dispatch actions, get the current state of the store, and subscribe to any changes.

Now, let's connect your Redux app to React via the `react-redux` bindings!
